## Document:

**Scene_File**: The simulation project of Sionna, containing 500 scene folders created and exported by Blender 3.6.

**RadioMap_raw**: The raw simulation output files generated by Sionna. The numbers in the filenames '1_10.npy' to '500_10.npy'
represent the simulated scene number. Each file has a shape of 256×256×10×6, corresponding to (Rx_coordinates(i),
Rx_coordinates(j), Tx_number, depth_max), and the values represent RSSI. Here, depth_max indicates the total number of
reflections and scatterings, with depth_max=0 representing the scenario where reflections and scatterings are not
considered.

**RSSI**: The grayscale image obtained after processing the RadioMap_raw file. The specific processing involves
converting the value at each point using \(\max\{\frac{P_{R} - P_{R, thr}}{P_{R, max} - P_{R, thr}}, 0\}\) to a value
between 0 and 1, where \(P_{R, max}\) is the maximum received signal strength value, which is -13dB, and \(P_{R, thr}\)
is set to -70dB. For example, `1_0_0.png` represents the RadioMap generated for the 1st scene, 0th Tx, and when
depth_max is 0.

**Tx**: The grayscale image representing the Tx position for each scene, where the pixel value 255 represents the Tx
position, and all other values are 0. For example, `1_0.png` represents the position map for the 0th Tx in the 1st
scene.

**Scene**: The grayscale image representing the scene, generated by performing a cross-section operation at 1.5 meters
in the 3D simulation scene. In this image, pixel value 0 represents buildings, and all other values are 0.

## Example of the RSSI maps corresponding to the Scenes and the Txs.

### Scene Image

| Scene 1                            | Tx 1_0                     |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| ![scene_1.png](figures/scene_1.png) | ![1_0.png](figures/1_0.png) |

### RadioMap Images

| RSSI 1_0_0                     | RSSI 1_0_1                     | RSSI 1_0_2                     |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| ![1_0_0.png](figures/1_0_0.png) | ![1_0_1.png](figures/1_0_1.png) | ![1_0_2.png](figures/1_0_2.png) |

| RSSI 1_0_3                     | RSSI 1_0_4                     | RSSI 1_0_5                     |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| ![1_0_3.png](figures/1_0_3.png) | ![1_0_4.png](figures/1_0_4.png) | ![1_0_5.png](figures/1_0_5.png) |

In the example, RSSI 1_0_0 indicates no reflection and scattering, while RSSI 1_0_1 indicates a total of one reflection
and scattering, and so on.

## Future

The dataset with each scene having more Txs is being processed and will be updated soon.
